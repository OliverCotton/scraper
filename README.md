# scraper

This web scraper scrapes sale items from the ethical superstore. The selenium library was used to steer a firefox browser through the sale items on the website. 

In this version (currenlty named v2), a folder is created for each product. In that folder is stored a JSON file containing the product information, and also the product image.
